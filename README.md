# Workspace Repository

This repository serves as a workspace for storing both preliminary and developmental versions of applications used as work tools. It includes backup versions or those created during periods of unavailability of work equipment to prevent downtime or resolve existing issues. These applications are fully developed by myself but may require corrections as they are temporary versions.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a centralized location for managing and accessing various versions of work-related applications. Whether it's for testing, development, or emergency situations, this workspace ensures that necessary tools are always accessible.

## Important info

Please note that detailed instructions and final versions are stored on the company's GitLab
